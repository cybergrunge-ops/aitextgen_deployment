# aitextgen deployment

this is a simple way to deploy aitextgen to a server using php shell exec apache
just install aitextgen on your server as per minimaxir repo
then include the php files i made in ur apache directory

aitextgen is made by minimaxir.

obligatory do your own research im not responsible blabla this is public domain code copyleft whatever.
note this is not a secure way to do things obviously. if you want security configure that yourself
i just use this on my own server to make a nicer interface than aitextgen's CLI.
