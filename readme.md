# aitextgen deployment

this is a simple way to deploy aitextgen to a server using php shell exec
just install aitextgen on your server then include the php files i made

the php itself is hereby public domain i accept no responsibility for it or maintain it.
aitextgen is made by minimaxir.

obligatory do your own research im not responsible blabla
note this is not a secure way to do things obviously. if you want security configure that yourself
i just use this on my own private server to make a nicer interface than aitextgen's CLI.
