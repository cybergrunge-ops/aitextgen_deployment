# aitextgen deployment

this is a simple way to deploy aitextgen to a server using php ssh2 execution

## requirements

VPS with apache and php 

## how to use

install aitextgen on your server

you can just clone this repo to root dir on vps and then unpack it

aitextgen is made by minimaxir i dont claim to have made it, he is the smart one.

obligatory do your own research im not responsible blabla this is public domain code 
note this is not a secure way to do things unless you have a firewall with whitelist. 
if you want security configure that yourself
i just use this on my own server to make a nicer interface than aitextgen's CLI because i dont know or want to learn python
